# Manipal Hackathon 2024

**Team Name:** `TechNomads`

**Problem Statement:** `INTERACTIVE TOURISM PLATFORM -> Tourism often lacks engagement and interactive experiences, leading to missed opportunities for travelers to discover unique local attractions and fully immerse themselves in local culture. Design a sophisticated gamified tourism application that motivates users to thoroughly explore their destination by earning points through uncovering hidden attractions and completing challenges and quests such as uploading photos taken from specific angles to match reference images. The application should also feature leaderboards, rewards, and integrated social sharing capabilities.`

## üìú Introduction

Our project, **TravelHunt**, is designed for **travelers and tourists** who want to enhance their exploration experiences by making travel more engaging and interactive. **TravelHunt** combines gamification with tourism by encouraging users to explore destinations through challenges, quests, and photo missions.

Using technologies like **React Native/Expo** for the app, **Node.js/Express** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for data storage, we created an immersive platform. The app allows users to:

- Earn points for discovering hidden attractions.
- Complete photo challenges where users match reference images of landmarks.
- Share their journey socially and participate in a global leaderboard.

Our platform transforms typical travel into a gamified experience, pushing users to fully experience the destination while competing for rewards and recognition.

## ‚ú® Features

### App:

- **Gamified Exploration**: Users can earn points by uncovering hidden attractions, completing photo challenges, and fulfilling quests.
- **Interactive Leaderboards**: Global leaderboards display user rankings based on points earned, motivating users to explore more.
- **Social Sharing Integration**: Users can share their completed challenges and discoveries on social media directly from the app.
